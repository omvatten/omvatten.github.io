# OM VATTEN
**Om Vatten** (Swedish) translates to **About Water**. This website is about my research and teaching, which revolve around water in various ways.

My research lies at the intersection of environmental engineering and microbial ecology. 
**Environmental engineering** focuses on safeguarding the environment and human health. 
This includes producing safe drinking water; managing wastewater, solid waste, and polluted air; remediating contaminated sites; and fostering a circular economy by recovering resources from waste streams.
**Microbial ecology** examines the interactions between microorganisms and their environments. 
Microbial communities are ubiquitous in nature and perform a vast array of chemical reactions. 
By designing innovative environmental engineering processes, we can harness these naturally occurring microorganisms to our advantage. 
For instance, they can degrade pollutants, produce energy carriers, or ensure the provision of safe drinking water and food.

The textbook Om Vatten is an introduction to water quality and water technology. 
It is written in Swedish and used as course literature in some of my courses.
