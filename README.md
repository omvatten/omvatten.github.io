# OM VATTEN
Om Vatten means About Water. This website is about my research and teaching, which are connected to water in various ways.

My research is in the interface of environmental engineering and microbial ecology.
*Environmental engineering* aims to protect the environment and human health.
It is about producing safe drinking water; managing used water, solid waste, and polluted air; cleaning up polluted sites; and promoting a circular economy by recovering resources from waste streams.
*Microbial ecology* is about interactions between microorganisms and their environment. Microbial communities are everywhere in nature and they carry out a wide range of chemical reactions.
By designing smart environmental engineering processes, we can make the naturally occurring microorganisms work for us. 
For example, by degrading pollutants, producing energy carriers, or ensuring a safe drinking water.
